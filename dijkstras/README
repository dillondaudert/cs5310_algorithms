- Overview -
Dijkstra's algorithm and All Shortest Paths implemented in Julia.

- Comments -
I use the DataStructures package for the priority queue in Dijkstra's
algorithm. This package is not in Julia.Base, but it should be installed
by default. If not, open the Julia REPL and add the package with:
    julia> Pkg.add("DataStructures")

- How To Use -
Executing 
    $> julia main.jl
builds the example graph found in ./test/ex_graph.txt and calculates all 
shortest paths, outputting as a formatted matrix.

To call for a different graph, execute:
    $> julia main.jl graphfile
where graphfile is the path to a text file with the
formatted description of a graph according to the project format.

- Unit Tests -
Unit tests for the Graph type are found in test/graph_tests.jl
Unit tests for the path algorithms are found in test/paths_tests.jl
To run, execute:   
    $> julia [graph|paths]_tests.jl
